# hello-world
New ideas, brainstorms.
I'm a newbie, but interested in becoming a pro in programming. The plan? HTML, CSS, Javascript...then revise the map. Hoping to be a remote employee, full-time, but flexible location so I can split my time between my family in California and in Vermont...3000 miles. And road trips in between.
